Hardware notes and installation

This document describes hardware needed, sources, and tools you'll need, 
as well as installation notes.

Tools and supplies
* A decent soldering iron
* Wire stripper capable of handling AWG22 through AWG28
* Crimper for 2.54mm pitch pins used on Arduino
* Crimp kit with housings and male and female pins, 2.54mm pitch.
  These are often referred to as Dupont connectors, although
  the connector has been relabeled a few times and the genuine
  brand is horribly expensive. You'll want to get the Chinese
  version on E-bay.
* Screwdriver, wirecutter, needlenose pliers
* Drill
* 1.25" #4 wood screws (for mounting Arduino to wooden base)
* #6 and #8 wood screws in various lengths
* Drywall anchor mount kit

Hardware components

Connection box
* Wooden base (to mount Arduino+shield on, along with terminal blocks)
* Screw-down terminal blocks (this helps in hooking up the rat's nest of
  sensor wires)
* Grounding bar (this helps in hooking up the common lead for all the sensor
  wires)
* I2C expander (8-port)
* Arduino Uno
* SEEEDStudio GPRS shield v2.0
* Existing logic board and 12V battery with wall power supply (we'll only use
  this to supply battery-backed 12V DC power to the Arduino)

Front panel
* Deep wooden picture frame (to hold Raspberry Pi and touchscreen, level shifter
  board, and speaker)
* Mounting for picture frame (can be made from 3/8" plywood using table saw
  and screws)
* USB power supply capable of 2.1A. In most places it's against electrical code
  to directly wire any device into household main supply, but you can install
  an outlet with USB power directly under the mount point for the touchscreen
* USB-powered speakers. You want speakers that are powered by USB but use a
  3.5mm stereo jack to connect to the Raspberry Pi.
* Raspberry Pi model 3.
* Raspberry Pi touchscreen.
* Level shifter board. This allows you to run a TTL-level serial connection from
  the connection box to the front panel over the existing 4-wire cable.

Installation requirements

The connection box should have a few inches of clearance. The terminal blocks
made for AC power are bigger than needed but can be gotten at any Home Depot.
Insertion-type terminal blocks would be easier to work with.

There should be a 4-wire cable with red, black, yellow and green wires (usually
18-gauge solid copper) running from the connection box to the front panel. We'll
use this for a TTL-level serial connection (using the level shifter board) between
the core monitor and the front panel. All four wires are needed (5VDC, ground, TX, RX).
There will be some voltage drop due to the wire length but it should be minimal, and
the level shifter handles the difference between the HV (Arduino) side and LV (Raspberry
Pi) side.

The sensor connections should be normally-closed. Use a digital multimeter to check.
You should see around 1.8 to 2.2 ohms resistance when closed (door closed, window closed).
When a door is opened, the circuit opens. If there is voltage on any of these, this
approach won't work and trying to connect may damage the Arduino.

Motion detectors may have a 3-wire or 4-wire connection. Two of the wires (usually red
and black) will supply 12V DC power and ground to the motion sensor. The other two wires
(or other one in relation to ground) are the normally-closed connection when no motion
is detected. When the passive infrared sensor detects motion and lights up, the normally
closed connection opens like the other sensors.

The front panel is going to need USB power for the USB speakers and for the Raspberry Pi.
An electric power receptacle with two USB charging ports can be installed. Make sure you
get someone to do this who knows how to follow local electric code, like an electrician.
Get this done first, since you'll want to cover this with the frame holding the Raspberry
Pi with touchscreen.
