Setting up Raspbian "jessie" OS

This document covers how to set up the Linux operating system, specifically
the Raspbian distro. You'll run the home monitor as an application. The instructions
here apply to a recent version codenamed "jessie."

You can google search raspbian jessie to find a page where you can download
a zip file. You'll need to install Win32DiskImager (on Windows) so that you
can write the .img file to a microSD card (earlier versions of Raspberry Pi
used regular SD cards).

Actual writing of the image is relatively simple. Run Disk Imager as administrator,
insert the SD card or USB adapter with the card, select the drive letter assigned
(make sure you don't choose other removable media - all data on it will be wiped!)
and select the jessie img file, then write image.

First boot
Before connecting the other hardware, you'll need to make a couple of changes.
Insert the microSD in the Raspberry Pi 3 with the touchscreen connected. You'll
need to connect a USB keyboard for this stage (it won't be needed later, and you
can also use a Bluetooth keyboard).

Essential checklist
Connect to wifi
Change password 
Select timezone

Open a shell session.
sudo apt-get install 

We need to turn off logins on the serial port, which we'll be using to
communicate with the Arduino board. Partly following this http://www.instructables.com/id/Read-and-write-from-serial-port-with-Raspberry-Pi/
sudo raspi-config
